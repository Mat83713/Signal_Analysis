# Signal Analysis

Project created by Maciej Matusiak. This application was designed and created as a part of academic programming classes in 2023. The application determines the distance from the obstacle using the received time that the signal needed to travel a given distance.  In this implementation, they have been designed and presented with the possibility of modification:

- Time of delay in milliseconds,
- Type of function used to create the signal,
